        <h5> Plot</h5>
          <p>  A woman wakes up with amnesia, in a house where television screens are showing an unknown symbol. Turning the screens off, she finds photos of herself and a man, along with one of a small girl which she takes with her. She leaves the house and pleads for help, but people ignore her while recording her on their phones. When a masked man opens fire at her with a shotgun, she flees and meets Jem. Jem explains that the symbol began appearing on television and mobile phone screens, turning most people into passive voyeurs. The woman and Jem are unaffected, but they are also a target for the "hunters", unaffected humans who act sadistically. Jem plans to reach a transmitter at "White Bear" to destroy it.

As they travel, Baxter, a man who is also unaffected, picks them up. He holds them at gunpoint in a forest, where he tries to torture the woman, but Jem kills Baxter first. They continue travelling to the transmitter; when they reach it, two hunters attack them. The woman wrestles a shotgun away from a hunter and fires at her attacker, but the gun only sprays confetti. Walls open to reveal that everything was staged.

The woman is strapped to a chair and informed that her name is Victoria Skillane, and that the girl in the photograph is Jemima Sykes, whom Victoria and her fiancé, Iain Rannoch, had abducted and murdered. After the pair were arrested, Iain committed suicide in his cell, while Victoria was sentenced to undergo daily psychological punishment at the present facility, which is called White Bear Justice Park.

Victoria is driven back to the compound past an outraged crowd and returned to where she awoke. As she is shown footage of Jemima, Baxter places electrodes on her head, simultaneously torturing her and wiping her memory of the day's events. Over the end credits, the next day's events are seen from the point of view of the park's staff, and its visitors who play the voyeurs.

    <h5> Plot</h5>
    <p>Joe Potter awakens in a cabin on a snowy Christmas Day, greeted by Matt Trent. The two have lived there for five years but barely spoken. To get Joe to open up, Matt explains why he ended up in the cabin. He used to run an online group who watched each other seduce women, through "Z-Eyes" which record vision and hearing. One member, Harry, crashed an office Christmas party and talked to Jennifer. She was mentally ill, heard voices and mistook his Z-Eyes communication for him doing so too. After they returned to her place, she poisoned them both in a murder-suicide.

Matt also talks about his job, training "cookies" of people—digital clones stored in an egg-shaped object—as personal assistants. He describes the experience of Greta's cookie, who refused to be a personal assistant. Matt fast-forwarded time inside the cookie's world for six months, and she relented under the threat of further boredom and isolation.

Joe reluctantly talks. He was "blocked" by his fiancée Beth after the two fought over her decision to have an abortion. Blocking causes them to see each other and their offspring as grey silhouettes and prevents Joe from contacting Beth. Months later, Joe tried to confront her still-pregnant silhouette, leading to legal enforcement of the block. Each Christmas Eve, Joe travelled to Beth's father's house to spy on the little girl. The block was removed when Beth died in a train accident, which allowed Joe to discover that Beth had an affair and he was not the child's father. In a distressed confrontation with Beth's father, Joe struck him with a snow globe, killing him, and left. The girl found her grandfather and set off into the snowy wilderness to get help, only to freeze to death.

While telling the story, the cabin gradually transforms into Beth's father's house. Joe and Matt are in a cookie, the five years having been a result of altered perception of time, and Joe's cookie has given testimony which can be used to convict Joe. In exchange for extracting the confession, Matt avoids imprisonment for his role in Harry's death, but he is now convicted as a sex offender and is permanently blocked by everyone. Meanwhile, an officer sets Joe's cookie to experience time at 1,000 years per minute, with the song "I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday"—which played as he killed Beth's father—on repeat.</p>

        <h4 id="s03ep01">Nosedive</h4>
        <p>The episode is set in a world where people can rate each other from one to five stars for every interaction they have, which can impact their socioeconomic status. Lacie (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a young woman overly obsessed with her ratings; she finds an opportunity to elevate her ratings greatly and move into a more luxurious residence after being chosen by her popular childhood friend (Alice Eve) as the maid of honour for her wedding. Her obsession leads to several mishaps on her journey to the wedding that culminate in a rapid reduction in her ratings.</P><br>

        <h5>Plot</h5>
        <p>Society has embraced a technology wherein everyone shares their daily activities through eye implants and mobile devices and rates their interactions with others on a scale of one to five stars, cumulatively affecting everyone's socioeconomic status.

Lacie Pound seeks to raise her 4.2 rating to 4.5 for a discount on a luxury apartment; however, despite her attempts to be an outgoing and pleasant socialite, her rating has plateaued. Lacie talks to a consultant who suggests gaining favour from very highly-rated people. Lacie uploads a photograph of Mr. Rags, a ragdoll that she and her childhood friend Naomi (Alice Eve) made together. Naomi, who is currently rated 4.8, rates the photo five stars and calls Lacie, saying that she is engaged and inviting Lacie to deliver a speech as the maid of honour. Lacie agrees and commits on the apartment, anticipating many high ratings from the guests.

On the day of her flight, several mishaps cause people to rate Lacie negatively, dropping her rating below 4.2. At the airport, her flight is cancelled and she cannot buy a seat on an alternate flight with her current rating. When Lacie causes a scene, security penalizes her by subtracting a full point for 24 hours. Because of her low rating, Lacie can only rent an older car to drive to the wedding, which she cannot recharge when it runs out of power. She is forced to hitchhike with Susan, a truck driver rated below 2.0. Susan tells Lacie that she used to care about her rating until her late husband was passed over for vital cancer treatment because their scores were deemed not high enough; she says she feels much freer without obsessing over ratings.

The next day, while Lacie is en route to the wedding, Naomi tells her to not come, as her severely reduced rating will negatively impact Naomi's own ratings. Enraged, Lacie reaches the wedding and sneaks in during the reception. She grabs the microphone and starts giving the speech she had written but becomes more and more upset, finally grabbing a knife and threatening to behead Mr. Rags. The guests rate Lacie negatively, causing her rating to fall below one star. Security arrives and arrests Lacie. She is taken to prison, and the technology supporting the rating system is removed from her eyes. She and the man in the cell opposite hers realise they can now speak without worrying about being rated, and gleefully hurl insults at each other.</p>

        <img src="https://www.framerated.co.uk/frwpcontent/uploads/2016/11/blackmirror303.jpg" height="259">
        <h5>Plot</h5>
        <p>Kenn returns home from his restaurant job to find that his younger sister Lindsay has unintentionally infected his laptop with malware. Kenny downloads an anti-malware trojan which allows an unseen hacker to record him masturbating through his laptop's camera. The hacker emails Kenny, threatening to send the video to his contacts unless he follows a series of instructions.

The next day at work, Kenny receives a text summoning him to a location 15 miles away in 45 minutes; he feigns illness to his boss and frantically cycles to the coordinates. He is met by a man acting on instructions from the hacker, who gives Kenny a box with a cake inside. Kenny is instructed to deliver the cake to a hotel room, where he finds Hector. Hector receives blackmail messages of his own; he was about to commit adultery with a prostitute, and fears he will lose custody of his children if his wife finds out.

Kenny and Hector are instructed to drive to a set of coordinates. At a stop for petrol they meet Karen, a friend of Hector's wife, who asks for a lift home. Hector drives recklessly to get her there before continuing to their destination. They are told to use a gun concealed in the cake to rob a bank. Hector insists on being the driver, leaving Kenny to perform the robbery. Though Kenny urinates out of fear, he manages to get a bag of cash and flee the scene with Hector.

Hector is instructed to destroy the car, while Kenny carries the money to a drop-off point in a nearby wood. There he meets another blackmail victim, who explains they are to fight to the death whilst being filmed through a camera-equipped drone; the money goes to the winner. When Kenny protests that he merely looked at pictures, the man asks how young the subjects were. Kenny attempts to shoot himself, but finds the gun is empty. The two begin to fight.

Hector returns home, but finds the hacker has sent his wife evidence of his infidelity. The other blackmail victims' information has also been released. They each receive a trollface image from the blackmailer. Having won the fight, an injured Kenny staggers from the woodland. He receives a distraught call from his mother, as Lindsay saw the video of him masturbating to child pornography. He ends the call as the police arrive.</p>

It was directed by Colm McCarthy and written by series creator Charlie Brooker, with one part adapted from a story by Penn Jillette. The episode premiered on Netflix, along with the rest of series four, on 29 December 2017.

        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Black_Mirror_S04E06_-_Black_Museum.png">
        <h5>Plot</h5>
        <p>Nish visits the remote Black Museum at a filling station. The proprietor, Rolo Haynes, explains the backstories to the museum's crime-related artefacts, starting with a hairnet device.

Rolo previously recruited people for experimental medical technology. In a flashback, Dr. Peter Dawson agrees to test a implant which makes him feel the physical sensations of the person wearing the hairnet. He learns the feeling of many conditions and is able to diagnose patients quickly. After experiencing a man dying, he becomes aroused by his patients' and girlfriend's pain. Addicted to it, he starts injuring his own body and murders a homeless man, which causes him to fall into a coma.

In the present, the air conditioner broken, Nish offers Rolo water. They move onto the origins of a toy monkey. Haynes convinces Jack to transfer his comatose wife Carrie's consciousness into part of his brain, so she can experience his physical sensations and communicate with him. Jack and Carrie become aggravated by their lack of privacy and agency, respectively. Jack uses the "pause" feature to stop Carrie from experiencing anything. After months, he feels guilty and unpauses her. Several weeks later they agree for her to be unpaused on weekends only. Jack begins dating Emily, who wants Carrie to be deleted. Rolo transfers Carrie to the toy monkey, which can feel sensations and say two phrases. Parker is quickly bored by it. The monkey technology was illegal, so Rolo is fired and takes Carrie with him.

The museum's centerpiece is a holographic Clayton Leigh. Rolo insists he was guilty of murder but Nish reminds him of conflicting evidence. While on death row, Clayton signed up to Rolo's exhibit: when a visitor pulls a lever, a conscious hologram of Clayton receives the electric chair, and a souvenir copy of him experiencing electrocution is made. The exhibit was immensely popular. Haynes begins to asphyxiate and Nish continues the story. After public protests, attendance to the exhibit dwindled to wealthy white supremacists, who left Clayton's hologram in a vegetative state. His wife overdosed the day after she saw him. Nish reveals herself as Clayton's daughter; she sabotaged the air conditioning and gave Rolo poisoned water.

Nish transfers Rolo's consciousness into Clayton's hologram, then electrocuting it, which creates a souvenir of Rolo. Nish takes Carrie with her and sets the museum on fire. She converses with her mother, whose consciousness is inside her head.</p>
